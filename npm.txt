we have two type of module:

# our own module
# built in module

the npm which is automatically installed with node allow to:

# reuse our own code in other projects
# use code written by other developers
# share our own solutions with other developers 


note:
# npm call the reusable code a package(we also call modules/dependencies)
# there is no quality control in npm registry i.e. anyone can publish anything
# the amount of weekly download is what determines a useful and secure package
# if you wanna get some packages, just go to npmjs.com to get them
# you can check the npm version by running npm --version in your terminal
# we can install packages as local dependencies(that means we can only use it in the current project by just writting npm i 'package name') or as a global dependencies(which means we can use it in any in our project by just writting npm i -g 'package name')
# we need to create package.json because it help store our packages. we create it by running 'npm init -y
# package.json helps provide information about our packages
